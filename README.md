Tumor-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes are crucial for anti-cancer immunity but can lose cytotoxic function in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), like anti-PD-1 therapy, enhance and prolong anti-tumor T cell responses. Despite its widespread clinical use, resistance to ICI develops in some patients, characterized by the proliferation of exhausted T cell (Tex). Here, we establish two single-cell murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models to explore regulatory network in Tex with ICI resistance. We uncover distinct T cell compositions, including both early and terminal Tex subsets, following prolonged ICI treatment, and reveal the differentiation trajectory of Tex subsets. Finally, we not only identify transcription factor Runx2 and its downstream targets as contributors to T cell exhaustion in both models, but discover ICI response correlates to Runx2 level in human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These findings elucidate Runx2 regulates T cell exhaustion in response to prolonged ICI treatment, influencing ICI efficiency, and suggest potential targets for combination therapy alongside ICI in HCC.
